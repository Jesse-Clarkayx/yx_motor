# Welcome to yx_motor
> Python client library for Alteryx Analytics Hub.  This is very early development, and the AAH API is still in preview mode. Do not consider this library stable until it is directly stated in the documentation.


## Installing 

Not ready yet.  Will update when we are ready to create a pip module.  The AAH API is still in alpha.  Once it's been hardened and finalized, we will update this library and release the module.  The command will be the following once this is ready:

`pip install yx_motor`

## Development Installation

Clone this branch down to your machine.

Create a virtual environment in your venv manager of choice.  Activate the environment, navigate to this directory, and then run `pip install -e .`
